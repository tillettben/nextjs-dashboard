# Future Testing Plan - Deferred Items

## Overview

This document outlines testing areas that were deprioritized in the initial comprehensive testing plan but should be considered for future implementation to achieve complete test coverage.

## Deferred Testing Areas

### 1. Error Handling & Edge Cases

**Why Deferred**: Focusing on happy paths initially
**Future Priority**: High

**Planned Tests**:

- Delete invoice error handling (intentional error in demo)
- Network failure scenarios
- Database connection errors
- Invalid form data submission edge cases
- Malformed URL parameters
- Server error responses (500, 503)
- Timeout handling
- CSRF protection testing

### 2. Performance Testing

**Why Deferred**: Not current priority
**Future Priority**: Medium

**Planned Tests**:

- Page load time measurements
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Bundle size analysis
- Database query performance
- Image loading optimization
- Search debouncing effectiveness
- Memory usage during navigation
- Large dataset handling (1000+ invoices)

### 3. Accessibility Testing

**Why Deferred**: Not current priority
**Future Priority**: High

**Planned Tests**:

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation flow
- ARIA label correctness
- Color contrast validation
- Focus management
- Tab order verification
- Form error announcements
- Skip navigation links
- Alternative text for images

### 4. Mobile & Responsive Testing

**Why Deferred**: Not current priority
**Future Priority**: Medium

**Planned Tests**:

- Mobile viewport testing (320px to 768px)
- Tablet viewport testing (768px to 1024px)
- Touch gesture support
- Mobile navigation menu functionality
- Table to card view transitions
- Mobile form usability
- Orientation change handling
- Mobile performance optimization

### 5. Security Testing

**Why Deferred**: Basic auth covered in main plan
**Future Priority**: High

**Planned Tests**:

- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF token validation
- Session hijacking prevention
- Password security requirements
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Cookie security settings
- Header security validation

### 6. Cross-Browser Compatibility

**Why Deferred**: Using Chromium only initially
**Future Priority**: Medium

**Planned Tests**:

- Firefox compatibility
- Safari/WebKit compatibility
- Edge compatibility
- Browser-specific feature support
- CSS compatibility issues
- JavaScript API differences
- File download behavior

### 7. Advanced User Workflows

**Why Deferred**: Complex scenarios not priority
**Future Priority**: Medium

**Planned Tests**:

- Bulk operations (multiple invoice actions)
- Data export functionality
- Advanced search combinations
- Concurrent user operations
- Long-running user sessions
- Multi-step workflows
- Undo/redo operations
- Draft saving functionality

### 8. Data Integrity Testing

**Why Deferred**: Basic CRUD covered in main plan
**Future Priority**: High

**Planned Tests**:

- Data consistency across operations
- Transaction rollback scenarios
- Concurrent modification handling
- Data validation at database level
- Foreign key constraint testing
- Data migration testing
- Backup and restore validation

### 9. Integration Testing

**Why Deferred**: E2E tests cover basic integration
**Future Priority**: Medium

**Planned Tests**:

- External API integration (if any)
- Email notification testing
- File upload/download testing
- Third-party service integration
- Database connection pooling
- Caching layer testing
- Authentication provider integration

### 10. Load & Stress Testing

**Why Deferred**: Single user focus initially
**Future Priority**: Low

**Planned Tests**:

- Concurrent user simulation
- Database performance under load
- Memory leak detection
- Resource usage monitoring
- Scalability testing
- Breaking point identification
- Recovery testing after overload
